Bugs and workarounds
--------------------
- If your BIOS freezes when you are about to save your settings and reboot, disable Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, which can be found under Advanced CPU Configuration in the OC menu.
- You cannot trust the search feature, as it does not look inside all sub-menus. For example, there is a feature called CPU VRM Over Temperature Protection under the DigitALL Power menu. Searching for VRM, however, gives zero results!
