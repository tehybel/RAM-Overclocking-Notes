Tips and tricks for MSI's BIOS
---------------------
- To find out the range of numbers a setting supports, you can put 99999 in and press enter. The BIOS will change the value to the highest supported right away.
- You can press the + and - keys to increase and decrease values by one. This also lets you find the lowest possible value, by holding down minus.
- You can press left/right to quickly jump downwards one category at a time
- The favorites feature is amazing for RAM OC. Press F2 anywhere to favorite a setting. Press F3 to enter favorites.
- Also, under F3, you can set things up to start at your preferred favorites page each time you enter the BIOS!

Bugs and workarounds
--------------------
- If your BIOS freezes or gets stuck when you are about to save your settings and reboot, disable Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, which can be found under Advanced CPU Configuration in the OC menu.
- You cannot trust the search feature, as it does not look inside all sub-menus. For example, there is a feature called CPU VRM Over Temperature Protection under the DigitALL Power menu. Searching for VRM, however, gives zero results!
- If you cannot POST with a high System Agent Voltage (VCCSA) then try setting CPU Over Temperature Protection to a higher value, or to Auto. At 96C, I cannot POST above 1.17v VCCSA.
